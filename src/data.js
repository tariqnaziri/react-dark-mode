    length: 13,
    snippet: `We’ve discovered neurons in CLIP that respond to the same concept whether presented literally, symbolically, or conceptually. This may explain CLIP’s accuracy in classifying surprising visual renditions of concepts, and is also an important step toward understanding the associations and biases that CLIP and similar models learn.`,

    length: 7,
    snippet: `The contributors to the Data Transfer Project believe portability and interoperability are central to innovation. Making it easier for individuals to choose among services facilitates competition, empowers individuals to try new services and enables them to choose the offering that best suits their needs.`,

    date: new Date(2018, 7, 11),
    length: 22,
    snippet: `Toyota has been taking various initiatives toward the creation of a hydrogen society, such as selling the "Mirai" FCEV and the "SORA" FCEV bus, selling FC systems to FC product companies, as well as allowing royalty-free use of its FCEV-related patent licenses. Through these experiences, the company has learned that many companies involved in FC products in a variety of industries are looking for FC systems that can be easily adapted to their own products.`,

    title: 'How Genetic Algorithms Can Compete with Gradient Descent and Backprop',
    date: new Date(2019, 5, 4),
    length: 5,
    snippet: `In the first step, a population is created from various random DNAs and the algorithm calculates the fitness values of the instances. In the next step, the algorithm drops a given percent of the population based on the fitness function (weak instances die) and creates new instances by genetic operators. Typical genetic operators are mutation (where the algorithm randomly change some of the genes) and crossover (where the algorithm randomly exchanges gene sequences in the instances).`,
