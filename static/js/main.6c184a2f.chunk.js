In the next step, the algorithm drops a given percent of the population based on the fitness function (weak instances die) and creates new instances by genetic operators. Typical genetic operators are mutation (where the algorithm randomly change some of the genes) and crossover (where the algorithm randomly exchanges gene sequences in the instances)."}],c=a(3),d=a.n(c),m=function(e){var t=e.title,a=e.snippet,n=e.date,s=e.length;return i.a.createElement("article",{className:"post"},i.a.createElement("h2",null,t),i.a.createElement("div",{className:"post-info"},i.a.createElement("span",null,d()(n).format("dddd Do, YYYY")),i.a.createElement("span",null,s," min read")),i.a.createElement("p",null,a))};var h=function(){var e=Object(n.useState)(function(){var e="light-theme";return localStorage.getItem("theme")&&(e=localStorage.getItem("theme")),e}()),t=Object(r.a)(e,2),a=t[0],s=t[1];return Object(n.useEffect)((function(){document.documentElement.className=a,localStorage.setItem("theme",a)}),[a]),i.a.createElement("main",null,i.a.createElement("nav",null,i.a.createElement("div",{className:"nav-center"},i.a.createElement("h1",null,"Dark Mode Toggle"),i.a.createElement("button",{className:"btn",onClick:function(){s("light-theme"===a?"dark-theme":"light-theme")}},"toggle"))),i.a.createElement("section",{className:"articles"},l.map((function(e){return i.a.createElement(m,Object.assign({key:e.id},e))}))))};o.a.render(i.a.createElement(i.a.StrictMode,null,i.a.createElement(h,null)),document.getElementById("root"))},5:function(e,t,a){e.exports=a(12)}},[[5,1,2]]]);
